						<li>Healthy: Since insects have less fat content.</li>
						<li>Enviromentally friendly: It takes less amount of food/plants to rear insects compared to cows.</li>

				<h2 class="title is-4">How are insects consumed(eaten)</h2>
				<p>Crickets have no distinctive flavour so they acquire the flavor of whatever they are mixed with.</p>
				<p>These insects are either:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Eaten whole. They are dry-roasted, baked, deep-fried or boiled.</li>
					<li>Turned/ processed into flour, protein bars or energy bars. The most common insect used to make flour, protein bars and energy bars is crickets.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Interesting fact: Eating insects as food is called entomophagy.</p>
