<h2>How are insects consumed(eaten)</h2>
<p>These insects are either:</p>
<ol>
	<li>eaten whole: they are dry-roasted, baked, deep-fried or boiled.</li>
	<li>turned/ processed into flour, protein bars or energy bars. The most common insect used to make flour, protein bars and energy bars is crickets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Interesting fact: Eating insects as food is called entomophagy.</p>

<h2>I want to start eating insects where do I start.</h2>

<p>Crickets have no so they acquire the flavor of whatever they are mixed with.</p>

<p>Great! I like your enthusiasm. There are 3 ways you can consume insects:</p>
<h3>As whole</h3>
<p>You would need to find out if there is a local restaurant in your area offering bugs in their menu. Eating insect is not yet mainstream so expect this as finding a needle in a haystack.</p>
<h3>Protein bars</h3>
<p>Since most people have never tasted cricket protein bars, companies offer a starter pack of about 4 flavours. That way if you like one or more flavour, you get to order more of that. You don't get stuck with protein bars you are going to trash.</p>
<p>Concider ordering sample packs from. Most companies sell them so that you can get to taste their products and choose the one you like.</p>
I have prepared a short list of sample packs you can test out.
Brand Flavours included Amazon Cmpany's web store


<h3>Cricket flour</h3>
<p>If you love cooking, you can experiment with some cricket flour in your own recipes or try out other cricket recipes.</p>
<p>You can add the flour to your own recipes to add the nutritional value.
