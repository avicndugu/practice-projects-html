        <h2>What You Need To Know</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Watch for symptoms</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
            </p>
            <p>These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Cough</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Know How it Spreads</h3>
            </li>
            <p>
                There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
                <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
            </p>

                <h3>Take steps to protect yourself</h3>
            </li>
            <h4>Clean your hands often</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
                </li>
               <li>
                    If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Avoid close contact</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Avoid close contact with people who are sick
                </li>
               <li>
                    Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
